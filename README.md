# hello-world

Helloooo,

my name is Sally, I am learning how to code which is exciting but also nerve-wracking!
I have already completed HTML and CSS and have just now started getting into the meat of
Javascript.. which is super confusing. I am hoping to use FCC concurrently with what I am
learning at Udemy right now. 

Thanks for reading and I'll see you on the other side!
